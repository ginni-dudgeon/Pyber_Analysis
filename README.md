# Pyber_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:


The purpose of this analysis is to provide PyBer insights into their ride-sharing services. Data was obtained from CSV files provided by PyBer entitled ride_data.csv and city_data.csv. The analysis was performed using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook


Results:


The analysis shows that ride-sharing income is consistent. However, the data shows that most of the companyâ€™s income comes from rides in urban cities. Suburban cities produce the next highest revenue. Rural cities provide the least amount of income.

The image above shows that the average fare per ride in rural cities is $34.62. The average fare per driver in these same cities is $55.49. Total fare is $4,327.93 The total number of rides is 125 with a total of 78 drivers.
Suburban cities have 625 total rides and 490 drivers. The total fares are $19,356.33. Average fare per ride is $30.97 with an average fare of $39.50 per driver.
Urban cities have a total fare of $39,854.38. There are 1,625 total rides with 2,405 drivers. The average fare per ride is $24.53 and the average fare per driver is $16.57.


Summary:


The most profitable city type is urban cities even though the fare per driver and fare per ride is much lower than the other cities. The sheer number of rides makes this a bigger money maker for PyBer. However, this indicates that drivers in urban cities make less than those in suburban or rural areas. 


Recommendations:


1.	A more in-depth study should be conducted that looks at the entire year and not just a portion of it. This could give PyBer some additional insights. 

2.	Even though rural cities generate less income for the company, this does not mean PyBer services are not needed. More information is needed to determine if there is need for more drivers in these areas. 

3.	After conducting an analysis to see if the demand is there, PyBer could add more rural drivers as a trial run to see if this generates more income and meets a need.
