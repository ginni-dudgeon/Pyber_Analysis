# Pyber_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:


The purpose of this analysis is to provide PyBer insights into their ride-sharing services. Data was obtained from CSV files provided by PyBer entitled ride_data.csv and city_data.csv. The analysis was performed using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook


Results:


The analysis shows that ride-sharing income is consistent. However, the data shows that most of the companyâ€™s income comes from rides in urban cities. Suburban cities produce the next highest revenue. Rural cities provide the least amount of income.
